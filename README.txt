# CarePriorities

CarePriorities is aimed at users who provide care for others, in their own homes or in a care setting. It's particularly for clients with learning disabilities or cognitive impairments, to help record and report enrichment activities and day to day routine

The idea of carepriorities is to provide a simple phone based UI, to enable carers to record information about clients quickly and easily.
These updates are intended to feed into a backend (yet to be written), or social media feed, to enable family & friends of the client to get a window into the clients daily life (or to feed into a backend service for care provider organisations to view activity among all their charges). It works something like this:

'Carer arrives at client's home'
'Carer makes a cup of tea for self and client, and they sit together and have tea and cake'
This is a great time to enter an event 'tea and cake', and take a snapshot to go with it. Hit 'share' and it will be posted on the clients FB/Instagram page, or appear on the backend activity feed for care admins to monitor.

# Caveats

You use this software at your own risk. Please make sure any risk is yours, and not a clients. No warranty of any sort is provided or implied. In particular, anyone who works with vulnerable people has a responsibility to protect their privacy and dignity. There is no guarantee of the security of any data in this application, so please be very careful about what you record.
(That's why, incidentally, the only client identifying field is 'preferredName', and there is no facility to record client address/dob/fullname. If you want those fields, please store them somewhere else)

Please note also that this is NOT a medication management system. Medication is included as an event because it's information that can be recorded as a part of a clients everyday life. DO NOT USE IT TO INFLUENCE YOUR CHOICE OF WHETHER MEDICATION IS ADMINISTERED OR NOT. For obvious reasons.

# Background

Carepriorities was inspired by the commercial software MyDiary, devised by Steve Piper in the early 2010s. MyDiary was available commercially for a time (and may still be).
It has a very much more comprehensive set of features, but is a rather more heavyweight product with a complex backend and case management facilities.

I was one of the original developers of MyDiary, and was disappointed by the limited take up within the care sector. It provides a really helpful window into the day to day lives of people who have difficulty communicating, which is helpful for everyone:
carers, family/friends, and the clients themselves.

Carepriorities takes a different direction centred around an android device.
