# CarePriorities

The idea of carepriorities is to provide a simple phone based UI, to enable carers to record information about clients quickly and easily.
These updates are intended to feed into a backend (yet to be written), or social media feed, to enable family & friends of the client to get a window into the clients daily life.

# Background

Carepriorities was inspired by the commercial software MyDiary, devised by Steve Piper in the early 2010s. MyDiary was available commercially for a time (and may still be).
It has a very much more comprehensive set of features, but obviously comes as a cost. I was one of the original developers of MyDiary, and was disappointed by the limited
take up within the care sector. It provides a really helpful window into the day to day lives of people who have difficulty communicating, which is helpful for everyone:
carers, family/friends, and the clients themselves.

Carepriorities takes a different direction, centred around an android device.
